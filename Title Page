        <h1>The Land of Amar</h1>
		<h2>A place where people hang</h2>
		<h3>A place devoid of faith</h3>
		<h5>The corruption within the soil</h5>
				
		"What, are you serious? This is all it takes?	
		<b>To reach this place?</b>" 
		<br>
		<br>
		
		"So. How did you hear about this Castle again?"<br>
		"Well, a ragged band of tough sailors stumbled into the Tavern at Holmsworth.
		They looked like they had been through some serious hell. So naturally I
		bought them a drink and queried them about their state. After five ales,
		one of the lads let slip that they had tried to steal a ?cursed jewel? from
		somewhere."<br>
		"I sure hope you didn't bring us all the way out here on a drunk story."<br>
		"No, no. After buying them a hearty meal of pork and potatoes,
		I managed to pry that they were trying to find some sort of enchanted jewel,
		and that they were looking for it in a workshop. Some sort of jewelcrafting workshop.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br> "I don't like the feel of this place. It's depressing."
		<br> 
		<br>
		<p>
			Let's say a prayer.<br>
			"Even the mighty can feel weak,
			even the strong may crumble.
			Protect us in the darkness ahead.

			There is a slight scent of musk in the air.<br>

			After a while, you begin to make out the faint outline of a castle wall.
			<br>
			As you get closer, you see it looming over you.
