        <h1>The Land of Amar</h1>
		<h2>A place where people hang</h2>
		<h3>A place devoid of faith</h3>
		<h5>The corruption within the soil</h5>
				
		"What, are you serious? This is all it takes?	
		<b>To reach this place?</b>" 
		<br>
		<br>
		
		"So. How did you hear about this Castle again?"<br>
		"Well, a ragged band of tough sailors stumbled into the Tavern at Holmsworth.
		They looked like they had been through some serious hell. So naturally I
		bought them a drink and queried them about their state. After five ales,
		one of the lads let slip that they had tried to steal a ?cursed jewel? from
		somewhere."<br>
		"I sure hope you didn't bring us all the way out here on a drunk story."<br>
		"No, no. After buying them a hearty meal of pork and potatoes,
		I managed to pry that they were trying to find some sort of enchanted jewel,
		and that they were looking for it in a workshop. Some sort of jewelcrafting workshop.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br> "I don't like the feel of this place. It's depressing."
		<br> 
		<br>
		<p>
			Let's say a prayer.<br>
			"Even the mighty can feel weak,
			even the strong may crumble.
			Protect us in the darkness ahead.

			<br> A Lady appears in the mist.
				A middle aged woman, with a ghastly complexion awaits at the front gate.
				She has a dim lantern with a yellow glow.
				The trio stops infront of the the gate and dismount. 
				One of the members speaks to the lady.
								<br>
				<br>
			
			"Excuse me, is this Castle Amarillion?" you ask.<br>
			"It is." The lady replies in a toneless voice.<br>
			<br>
			<i>why is she standing in front of a castle in this forlorn place</i>
			<br>
			<br>
			"We have come to visit." You say in a friendly tone.
			<br>
			"No you haven't." She replies directly.
			<br>
			Taken a back. You take a moment to think of what to say.
			<br>
			<br> [What would you like to say?]<br>
			<br>
			Who is the rule of this castle? We wish to see them.<br>
			<br>
			<i>she stares at you with her hollow gaunt eyes</i><br>
			<br>
			<b>She sighs.</b>
			<br>
			<i>Amarus is the head of this castle.<br>
			He is the ruler of this domain.</i><br><br>
			<u>If you wish to speak to him, you will find him in his chambers.</u> <br><br>
			<em>Don't say I didn't warn you.</em> She replies, seethingly<br>
			<strong>I can tell you about him if you wish.</strong><br><br>
			[Do you wish to hear more about Amarus?]<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<hr>
				Amarus The Cruel - Warden of Castle Amarillion, he is a torturous human, who enjoys cutting and burning young women,
				he would abduct them and chain them in his basement dungeons, where he would make them scream and suffer.
				Their suffering was his pleasure. The long, deep screams, the howls of pain and the begging.
			<hr>
			<br> You look at her stunned, unsure of what to make of the information.<br>
			<br> Taken aback, you remember you manners.
			<br> "I'm sorry, I never asked who you were."<br>
			<br>
			<br> <i>Don't be. Few people care.</i> She replies with scorn.
			<br>
			<br> "So how do I refer to you?" You add, trying to be as polite as possible.<br>
			<br> <i>I am Lady Emmantra Liverstone</i> - Warden of The Gates of Castle Amarillion -
			<br> 
			<br> You take a moment to think on this information.<br>
			<br> [What would you like to do now?]
			<br> 
			<br> You decide to be honest. One of you steps forward and says -<br>
			"We are here in search of a cursed jewel."
			<br>
			<br> <i>Lady Emmantra smiles for the first time.</i>
			<br>
			<br> Yes the cursed jewel, a group of sailors tried to break in not long ago.
			<br> I think we still a have a few bodies left from that raid. They will make good fertiliser.
			<br>
			<br> [What would you like to say?]
			<br>
			<br> You decide to be direct. "Will you tell us how to find it?" 
			<br>
			<br> Yes, but in return, I ask for a favour.
			<br>
			<br> [What would you like to say or do?]
			<br>
			<br> You decide to hear her out. <br> "Name it and we will do our best to help you."
			<br>
			<br> I have been trapped here for seventeen years. I was abducted at the age of fifteen.
			<br> Amarus raped me and tortured me for months but I would not yield. 
			<br> My spirit never broke and he asked me if I wanted a quick death or to go to the Isles far away.
			<br> I told him I wanted neither and rather than killing me, he let me stay.
			<br> This was seventeen years ago.
			<br>
			<br> <i> I wish to leave this place. </i>
			<br>
			<br> [What would you like?]
			<br>
			<br> "How can we help?" One of you asks.<br>
				<hr>
				<br> Amarus use to have an old councillor named Salazar. 
					His moniker was 'Midas' as every venture he was involved in turned into gold.
					I have often seen Amarus reading a tome written by Salazar.
					I wish to read it, I wish to have that tome.
					<b>I want to acquire my financial freedom.</b>
					In order to leave this place. I need to have that tome.
					<i>If you see it on your journeys, can you bring it back to me?</i><br>
					She asks in a pleading tone.
				<hr>
			
			<br>
			<br>
			<br> [What would you like to do?] <br>
			<br> You reply <br>
			<br> <i>"Yes, if I can get the tome, I'll bring it back you."</i>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br> [You have accepted a quest]
			<br> [Salazar's Tome of Finance]<br>
			<br> You take out your parchment and write a note down. <br> Tome Of Salazar. For Lady Emmantra, Gates of Castle Amarillion.
			<br>
			<br> [Ask Lady Emmantra for details?]
			<br>
			<br> Can you tell me more about this Tome?
			<br>
			<br> <i>The Tome of Salazar is a blue and silver bound book. 
				There is only one of it as it was penned by Salazar himself.
				Amarus has never let me read the book. 
				Everytime I was left alone, he would hide the book from me.
				I didn't even know what I was. It is only because he tried to keep it hidden from me, that I know it is important.
				<br>
				<br>
				One day, he was busy with a newly found victim. He had forgotten to lock his book away.
				I walked up to the book and saw the cover. OLIVEIRA | SALAZAR. That is what is written on the tome.
				I only managed to read a few pages before I lost my nerve and went back to my quarters.
				From what I had gleaned though, I know the information within is valuable.
				<br>
				<i>It is considered his magnum opus.</i>
				<br>
				<br>
				One more thing. This tome is highly treasured by Amarus, he would keep it separately from his other books in the library.
				<br>
				</i>
				
				<br>"I will do my best to recover the tome. You have my honor and my word."
				<br>
				<br> <i>Then I bid you, fare well.</i>
				<br>
				<br> Lady Emmantra turns around and walks towards the locked gate.
				<br> The air grows cold and still as she nears. Snow falls from the heavens pure.
				<br>
				<br> &nbsp * * * * * * * * * 
				<br> * * * * * * * * *
				<br>
				<br> The sound of her footsteps drift away. A sandy crunching noise on the freshly fallen snow.
				<br>
				<br> As she reaches the gate.
					<i>She reaches into her robe and withdraws a steel key.</i>
					<br>
					<br>
					She unlocks the gate and pushes it open.
					<br>
					<br> You and your group mount up again and begin to walk in.
					<br> 
 					<br> As you pass Lady Emmantra, she stops you. She reaches into her robe and pulls out a small envelope.
					<br> She hands it to you.
					<br>
					<br> [Take or refuse envelope from Lady Emmantra]
					<br>
					<br> You decide to take it.
					<br>
					<br> You have acquired [Envelope containing: Distintergrating Key to The Gates of Castle Amarillion]
					<br>
					<br> <i>In case you need to unlock it.</i> She says with a nod. 
					<br>
					<br> One of you takes the envelope. 
					<br> [Would you like to put the key on your key chain?]
					<br>
					<br> You put the Disintergrating Key onto your keychain among your other keys.
					<br>
					<br> You have an old yellow envelope the key came in. 
					<br> [Keep, Discard]
					<br>
					<br> You decide to keep the old yellow envelope. <br>
					<br> <i>You thank Lady Emmantra </i><br>
					<br> Your group rides through the gate in single file. <br>
